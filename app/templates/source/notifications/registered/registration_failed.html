Hey there, {{ signup.firstname }}!

We couldn't help but notice that you left in the middle of registration! Was it something we said?

Just in case you change your mind, and you'd still like to register... the signup form is waiting, <a href="{{ link('auth/register', k=encrypt(signup.key.urlsafe())) }}">filled out just for you!</a>

Thanks for your interest in our beta, and we hope you enjoy the platform! It is still under active development, and we welcome early feedback.

Just reach out at <a href="mailto:disrupt@openfi.re">disrupt@openfi.re</a> if there's anything we can do!

Thanks,
-the openfire team
