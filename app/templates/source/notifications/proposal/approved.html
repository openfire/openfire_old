Hey {{ user.firstname }}!

We're writing with great news! Your proposal, "{{ proposal.name }}", just got approved by an openfire staff member!

In the next few hours, your proposal will be upgraded to an official project. This means you'll be ready to accept contributions soon!

Don't worry, your new project is still private and definitely not displayed on the site publicly. You can add viewers, other owners, and share a private URL for your friends, however.

Take a look at your <a href="{{ link('project/home', key=project.key.urlsafe()) }}">new project page</a>:
{{ link('project/home') }}

Thanks for your interest in our beta, and we hope you enjoy the platform! It is still under active development, and we welcome early feedback.

Just reach out at <a href="mailto:disrupt@openfi.re">disrupt@openfi.re</a> if there's anything we can do!

Thanks,
-the openfire team
