Hey there, {{ user.firstname }}!

You just followed a project on openfire: <a href="{{ link('custom_url', customurl=project.get_custom_url()) }}">{{ project.name }}</a>!

This means you'll get updates about {{ project.name }}'s progress, and updates posted by the project creators!

Thanks for your interest in our beta, and we hope you enjoy the platform! It is still under active development, and we welcome early feedback.

Just reach out at <a href="mailto:disrupt@openfi.re">disrupt@openfi.re</a> if there's anything we can do!

Thanks,
-the openfire team
