Hey there, {{ user.firstname }}!

You just backed a project on openfire: <a href="{{ link('custom_url', customurl=project.get_custom_url()) }}">{{ project.name }}</a>!

Your contribution at the "{{ contribution.tier.name }}" tier in the amount of ${{ contribution.amount }} makes you backer #{{ project.backers }}.

It also brought {{ project.name }} up to {{ project.progress }} completion towards the next goal!

Thanks for your interest in our beta, and we hope you enjoy the platform! It is still under active development, and we welcome early feedback.

Just reach out at <a href="mailto:disrupt@openfi.re">disrupt@openfi.re</a> if there's anything we can do!

Thanks,
-the openfire team
