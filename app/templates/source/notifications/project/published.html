Hey there, {{ user.firstname }}!

Your project, {{ project.name }}, has officially been published on openfire!

Now that your project is public, interactions and views of your project page will start being sent to Google Analytics! If you haven't entered your account ID yet, you should do it soon from your project page admin tools.

Also, the <a href="{{ link('custom_url', customurl=project.get_custom_url()) }}#socialreach" alt="{{ project.name }}'s social reach!">social reach tab on your project's homepage will show a lot more data now. This data is only available for project owners.

Thanks for your interest in our beta, and we hope you enjoy the platform! It is still under active development, and we welcome early feedback.

Just reach out at <a href="mailto:disrupt@openfi.re">disrupt@openfi.re</a> if there's anything we can do!

Thanks,
-the openfire team
