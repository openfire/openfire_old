Hey there, {{ user.firstname }}!

Your project, {{ project.name }}, just scored another backer!
<a href="{% if donor.has_custom_url() %}{{ link('custom_url', customurl=donor.get_custom_url()) }}{% else %}{{ link('user/profile', username=donor.username) }}{% endif %}">{{ donor.firstname }} {{ donor.lastname[0] }}</a> just contributed at the {{ contribution.tier.name }} tier, with ${{ contribution.amount }}!

This brings your project donor count up to {{ project.backers }}, with a total amount of ${{ project.money }} in contributions.

This puts you {{ project.progress }}% towards your next goal! Congrats!
