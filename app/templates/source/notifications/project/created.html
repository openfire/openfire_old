hey there, {{ user.firstname }}!

Your proposal, {{ proposal.name }}, has been promoted to a project! Don't worry, it's not public or anything yet. It is, however, ready for your discerning project creator's eye!

To check it out and start filling out project details, head on over to your new <a href="{{ link('project/home', key={{ encrypt(project.key) }}) }}" alt="{{ project.name }}'s new project page!">project page</a>! Or, enter the following URL into your browser:

{{ link('project/home', key=encrypt(project.key)) }}

That URL is long, huh! It'll get shorter when you pick a custom one for your project.

Thanks for your interest in our beta, and we hope you enjoy the platform! It is still under active development, and we welcome early feedback.

Just reach out at <a href="mailto:disrupt@openfi.re">disrupt@openfi.re</a> if there's anything we can do!

Thanks,
-the openfire team
